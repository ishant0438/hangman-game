# hangman-game
Created a Hangman game which is about guessing letters in a random word.

Explanation:

Word Selection: A random word is chosen from a list.
Game Mechanics: The player has 6 lives, losing one for each incorrect guess. They guess letters until they either complete the word or run out of lives.
Input Validation: The game checks for already-used letters and ensures only alphabetical characters are entered.
Win/Loss Outcome: The game ends when the word is guessed or lives reach zero.
